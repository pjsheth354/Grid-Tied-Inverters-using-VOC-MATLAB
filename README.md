# Grid-Tied-Inverters-using-VOC-MATLAB
This study seeks to examine the complexity of Voltage-Oriented Control (VOC) coupled with a decoupling controller for grid-tied inverters. Through extensive study and analysis, we want to understand the fundamental concepts behind VOC and its use in improving the performance of grid-tied inverters. This study also includes the design and implementation of a sinusoidal pulse width modulation technique suited exclusively for grid-tied inverters, which ensures efficient and dependable operation. Furthermore, we investigate the dynamics of active and reactive power regulation in grid-tied inverters in order to explain techniques for efficient power management and grid integration. By attaining these goals, this study helps to further our understanding and practical use of grid-tied inverter systems in current power networks.
